	abstract = {{he size distribution of pancake ice floes is calculated from images acquired during a voyage to the Antarctic marginal ice zone in the winter expansion season. Results show that 50\% of the sea ice area is made up of floes with diameters of 2.3–4m. The floe size distribution shows two distinct slopes on either side of the 2.3–4m range, neither of which conforms to a power law. Following a relevant recent study, it is conjectured that the growth of pancakes from frazil forms the distribution of small floes (D<2.3m), and welding of pancakes forms the distribution of large floes (D>4m).}},

	abstract = {{High temporal resolution in situ measurements of pancake ice drift are presented, from a pair of buoys deployed on floes in the Antarctic marginal ice zone during the winter sea ice expansion, over 9 days in which the region was impacted by four polar cyclones. Concomitant measurements of wave-in-ice activity from the buoys are used to infer that the ice remained unconsolidated, and pancake ice conditions were maintained over at least the first 7 days. Analysis of the data shows (i) the fastest reported ice drift speeds in the Southern Ocean; (ii) high correlation of drift velocities with the surface wind velocities, indicating absence of internal ice stresses >100km from the ice edge where remotely sensed ice concentration is 100\%; and (iii) presence of a strong inertial signature with a 13hr period. A Lagrangian free drift model is developed, including a term for geostrophic currents that reproduce the 13hr period signature in the ice motion. The calibrated model provides accurate predictions of the ice drift for up to 2days, and the calibrated parameters provide estimates of wind and ocean drag for pancake floes under storm conditions.}},

	abstract = {{The marginal ice zone is the dynamic interface between the open ocean and consolidated inner pack ice. Surface gravity waves regulate marginal ice zone extent and properties, and, hence, atmosphere-ocean fluxes and ice advance/retreat. Over the past decade, seminal experimental campaigns have generated much needed measurements of wave evolution in the marginal ice zone, which, notwithstanding the prominent knowledge gaps that remain, are underpinning major advances in understanding the region’s role in the climate system. Here, we report three-dimensional imaging of waves from a moving vessel and simultaneous imaging of floe sizes, with the potential to enhance the marginal ice zone database substantially. The images give the direction–frequency wave spectrum, which we combine with concurrent measurements of wind speeds and reanalysis products to reveal the complex multi-component wind-plus-swell nature of a cyclone-driven wave field, and quantify evolution of large-amplitude waves in sea ice. Unprecedented 3D imaging of waves and sea ice floes from a moving icebreaker in the Antarctic marginal ice zone during a polar cyclone reveals a complex wind-plus-swell sea state, where contrasting ice-driven attenuation and wind forcing coexist.}},

	abstract = {{Wave and sea ice properties in the Arctic and Southern Oceans are linked by feedback mechanisms, therefore the understanding of wave propagation in these regions is essential to model this key component of the Earth climate system. The most striking effect of sea ice is the attenuation of waves at a rate proportional to their frequency. The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS), a fundamental model for ocean waves, describes the full growth-decay cycles of unstable modes, also known as modulational instability (MI). Here, a dissipative NLS (d-NLS) with characteristic sea ice attenuation is used to model the evolution of unstable waves. The MI in sea ice is preserved, however, in its phase-shifted form. The frequency-dependent dissipation breaks the symmetry between the dominant left and right sideband. We anticipate that this work may motivate analogous studies and experiments in wave systems subject to frequency-dependent energy attenuation.}},

In turn, sea ice properties are modified by wave action. Understanding the interaction of ice and waves is important for characterizing both air‐sea interactions and sea ice dynamics. Current leading theory attributes wave attenuation primarily to scattering by ice floes. Here we use new in situ wave measurements to show that attenuation is dominated by dissipation with negligible effect by scattering. Time series of wave height in ice exhibit an “on/off” behavior that is consistent with switching between two states of sea ice: a relatively unbroken state associated with strong damping (off), possibly caused by ice flexure, and very weak attenuation (on) across sea ice that has been broken up by wave action. Waves created by wind at the ocean surface are strongly attenuated when they travel across ice‐covered regions. Until now, this effect was thought to be the result of reflection of waves off pieces of ice. Using new measurements of wave directions, we show that waves do not come from a broad range of directions, and scattering must be weak. Instead, we find that attenuation is highly variable and related to the size of ice floes. We hypothesize that attenuation may be caused by cyclic deformation of the ice. When the waves are large enough to break the ice up, this deformation stops, and the attenuation is much less. This finding is important for forecasting waves in ice‐infested waters as well as predicting seasonal sea ice extent.

	abstract = {{With the increasing resolution of operational forecasting models, the marginal ice zone (MIZ), the area where waves and sea ice interact, can now be better represented. However, the proper mechanics of wave propagation and attenuation in ice, and especially their influence on sea ice dynamics, still remain poorly understood and constrained in models. Observations have shown exponential wave energy decrease with distance in sea ice, particularly strong at higher frequencies. Some of this energy is transferred to the ice, breaking it into smaller floes and weakening it, as well as exerting a stress on the ice similar to winds and currents. In this article, we present a one-dimensional, fully integrated wave and ice model that has been developed to test different parameterizations of wave–ice interactions. The response of the ice cover to the wind and wave radiative stresses is investigated for a variety of wind, wave and ice conditions at different scales. Results of sensitivity analyses reveal the complex interplay between wave attenuation and rheological parameters and suggest that the compressive strength of the MIZ may be better represented by a Mohr-Coulomb parameterization with a nonlinear dependence on thickness.}},

	abstract = {{A three-dimensional model of wave scattering by a large array of floating thin elastic plates is used to predict the rate of ocean wave attenuation in the marginal ice zone in terms of the properties of the ice cover and the incoming wavefield. This is regarded as a small step toward assimilating interactions of ocean waves with areas of sea ice into oceanic general circulation models. Numerical results confirm previous findings that attenuation is predominantly affected by wave period and by the average thickness of the ice cover. It is found that the shape and distribution of the floes and the inclusion of an Archimedean draft has little impact on the attenuation produced. The model demonstrates a linear relationship between ice cover concentration and attenuation. An additional study is conducted into the directional evolvement of the wavefield, where collimation and spreading can both occur, depending on the physical circumstances. Finally, the attenuation predicted by the new three-dimensional model is compared with an existing two-dimensional model and with two sets of experimental data, with the latter producing convincing agreement.}},

	abstract = {{Exponential attenuation of ocean surface waves in ice-covered regions of the polar seas is modelled in a two-dimensional, linear setting, assuming that the sea ice behaves as a thin-elastic plate. Attenuation is produced by natural features in the ice cover, with three types considered: floes, cracks and pressure ridges. An inelastic damping parameterization is also incorporated. Efficient methods for obtaining an attenuation coefficient for each class of feature, involving an investigation of wave interaction theory and averaging methods, are sought. It is found that (i) the attenuation produced by long floes can be obtained from the scattering properties of a single ice edge; and (ii) wave interaction theory in ice-covered regions requires evanescent and damped-propagating motions to be included when scattering sources are relatively nearby. Implications for the integration of this model into an oceanic general circulation model are also discussed.}},

	abstract = {{The Antarctic marginal ice zone (MIZ) is a highly dynamic region where sea ice interacts with ocean surface waves generated in ice-free areas of the Southern Ocean. Improved large-scale (satellite-based) estimates of MIZ extent and variability are crucial for understanding atmosphere–ice–ocean interactions and biological processes and detection of change therein. Legacy methods for defining the MIZ are typically based on sea ice concentration thresholds and do not directly relate to the fundamental physical processes driving MIZ variability. To address this, new techniques have been developed to measure the spatial extent of significant wave height attenuation in sea ice from variations in Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) surface heights. The poleward wave penetration limit (boundary) is defined as the location where significant wave height attenuation equals the estimated error in significant wave height. Extensive automated and manual acceptance/rejection criteria are employed to ensure confidence in along-track wave penetration width estimates due to significant cloud contamination of ICESat-2 data or where wave attenuation is not observed. Analysis of 304 ICESat-2 tracks retrieved from four months of 2019 (February, May, September and December) reveals that sea-ice-concentration-derived MIZ width estimates are far narrower (by a factor of ∼7 on average) than those from the new technique presented here. These results suggest that indirect methods of MIZ estimation based on sea ice concentration are insufficient for representing physical processes that define the MIZ. Improved large-scale measurements of wave attenuation in the MIZ will play an important role in increasing our understanding of this complex sea ice zone.}},

	abstract = {{The retreat of Arctic sea ice is enabling increased ocean wave activity at the sea ice edge, yet the interactions between surface waves and sea ice are not fully understood. Here, we examine in situ observations of wave spectra spanning 2012–2021 in the western Arctic marginal ice zone (MIZ). Swells exceeding 30cm are rarely observed beyond 100km inside the MIZ. However, local wind waves are observed in patches of open water amid partial ice cover during the summer. These local waves remain fetch-limited between ice floes with heights less than 1m. To investigate these waves at climate scales, we conduct experiments varying wave attenuation and generation in ice with a global model including coupled interactions between waves and sea ice. A weak high-frequency attenuation rate is required to simulate the local waves in observations. The choices of attenuation scheme and wind input in ice have a remarkable impact on the extent of wave activity across ice-covered oceans, particularly in the Antarctic. As well as demonstrating the need for stronger constraints on wave attenuation, our results suggest that further attention should be directed towards locally generated wind waves and their role in sea ice evolution.}},

Pancake and frazil ice were sampled at seven stations at varying distances from the ice edge. The ice cover was further characterized from above, using helicopter aerial photography, and from below, using a remotely operated vehicle. Previously undescribed two-layer pancake types were observed and classified. A novel pancake growth mechanism is introduced to account for these, involving the washing of frazil ice over the pancake top surface and its subsequent freezing. The process was directly observed in ice tank experiments. Layer thicknesses seen in the field were compared to the ice growth that would occur both under calm conditions and from free-surface frazil ice growth. Classical, bottom accretion, pancake growth was found to proceed at a rate similar to that of thin congelation ice. Top-layer growth was more rapid, at approximately double the congelation rate. Overall ice volume production was similar to congelation ice for the thin pancakes considered (∼20 cm), though subsequent thickening was expected to be faster as the rapid top-layer process continued and the equivalent congelation growth slowed. It is suggested that parameterization of this new process is important for models that aim to simulate the rapid advance and thickening of wave-influenced ice covers.}},

The buoys remained in the ice as the pancakes consolidated into a coherent ice sheet, and the study examined the contrasts in dynamics for equivalent periods before and after consolidation. Drift velocities were largely determined by the meridional component, perpendicular to the ice edge. Prior to consolidation, these showed significantly elevated magnitudes at high frequencies (periods shorter than six hours). Scalar velocities were higher than previously reported values, reducing with time and distance from the ice edge. The same trends were not evident from in situ wind data. Derivation of momentum transfer parameters (wind factor, turning angle) was hampered by a lack of reliable wind directions from the outermost buoys, however. Relative motions between buoys were investigated using differential kinematic parameters. These displayed high amplitude, high frequency oscillations in unconsolidated ice, with RMS invariant values up to two orders of magnitude higher than normally reported for Weddell Sea pack ice. The values were found to be strongly dependent on sampling interval, increasing further at intervals less than one hour. In situ winds did not display an equivalent variation, suggesting that wind-forcing was not responsible, and translation under wave action, either internal or surface gravity, was postulated as the forcing.}},

	abstract = {{Data are presented from a survey by airborne scanning laser profilometer and an AUV-mounted, upward looking swath sonar in the spring Beaufort Sea. The air-snow (surface elevation) and water-ice (draft) surfaces were mapped at 1 × 1 m resolution over a 300 × 300 m area. Data were separated into level and deformed ice fractions using the surface roughness of the sonar data. The relation (R = d/f) between draft, d, and surface elevation, f, was then examined. Correlation between top and bottom surfaces was essentially zero at full resolution, requiring averaging over patches of at least 11 m diameter to constrain the relation largely because of the significant error (∼15 cm) of the laser instrument. Level ice points were concentrated in two core regions, corresponding to level FY ice and refrozen leads, with variations in R attributed primarily to positive snow thickness variability. Deformed ice displayed a more diffuse “cloud,” with draft having a more important role in determining R because of wider deformed features underwater. Averaging over footprints similar to satellite altimeters showed the mean surface elevation (typical of ICESat) to be stable with averaging scale, with R = 3.4 (level) and R = 4.2 (deformed). The “minimum elevation within a footprint” characteristic reported for CryoSat was less stable, significantly overestimating R for level ice (R > 5) and deformed ice (R > 6). The mean draft difference between measurements and isostasy suggests 70 m as an isostatic length scale for level ice. The isostatic scale for deformed ice appears to be longer than accessible with these data (>300 m).}},

The pack ice broke up around the buoy on 14th September 2000 as large amplitude storm waves approached the ice edge at the buoy’s location. The WAM model is modified to allow waves to propagate into the ice cover, in contrast to the operational scheme which sets wave energy to zero at ice concentrations over 30%. A simple, lookup-table-based, wave scattering attenuation scheme is then added and is combined with a sea ice drag attenuation parameterisation. WAM results at the location of the buoy are compared to the observations over a two-month period straddling the breakup. The modified WAM scheme generally reproduces the significant wave height, wave period and spectral characteristics measured by the buoy, though the model does not yet have any concept of floe breaking and re-freezing, assuming only that the ice cover is broken if the concentration is less than 80%. The simplistic nature of these modifications is designed to allow operational implementation, to eventually provide a global assessment of the wave-influenced ice zone.}},

The buoys were designed to drift with the ice throughout the year and monitor the expected breakup and retreat of the ice cover, forced by waves travelling into the ice from open water. Buoys were deployed from fast-and-light air-supported ice camps, based out of Sachs Harbour on Canada’s Banks Island, and drifted westwards with the sea ice over the course of spring, summer and autumn, as the ice melted, broke up and finally re-froze. The buoys transmitted heave, roll and pitch timeseries at 1 Hz sample frequency over the course of up to eight months, surviving both convergent ice dynamics and significant waves-in-ice events. Twelve of the 19 buoys survived until their batteries were finally exhausted during freeze-up in late October/November. Ice impact was found to have contaminated a significant proportion of the Kalman-filter-derived heave records, and these bad records were removed with reference to raw x/y/z accelerations. The quality of magnetometer-derived buoy headings at the very high magnetic field inclinations close to the magnetic pole was found to be generally acceptable, except in the case of four buoys which had probably suffered rough handling during transport to the ice. In general, these new buoys performed as expected, though vigilance as to the veracity of the output is required.}},

	abstract = {{The marginal ice zone (MIZ) is the boundary between the open ocean and ice-covered seas, where sea ice is significantly affected by the onslaught of ocean waves. Waves are responsible for the breakup of ice floes and determine the extent of the MIZ and floe size distribution. When the ice cover is highly fragmented, its behavior is qualitatively different from that of pack ice with large floes. Therefore, it is important to incorporate wave-ice interactions into sea ice–ocean models. In order to achieve this goal, two effects are considered: the role of sea ice as a dampener of wave energy and the wave-induced breakup of ice floes. These two processes act in concert to modify the incident wave spectrum and determine the main properties of the MIZ. A simple but novel parameterization for floe breaking is derived by considering alternatively ice as a flexible and rigid material and by using current estimates of ice critical flexural strain and strength. This parameterization is combined with a wave scattering model in a one-dimensional numerical framework to evaluate the floe size distribution and the extent of the MIZ. The model predicts a sharp transition between fragmented sea ice and the central pack, thus providing a natural definition for the MIZ. Reasonable values are found for the extent of the MIZ given realistic initial and boundary conditions. The numerical setting is commensurate with typical ice-ocean models, with the future implementation into two-dimensional sea ice models in mind.}},

	abstract = {{The seasonality of sea ice in the Southern Ocean has profound effects on the life cycle (phenology) of phytoplankton residing under the ice. The current literature investigating this relationship is primarily based on remote sensing, which often lacks data for half of the year or more. One prominent hypothesis holds that, following ice retreat in spring, buoyant meltwaters enhance available irradiance, triggering a bloom which follows the ice edge. However, an analysis of Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) data sampling under Antarctic sea ice suggests that this is not necessarily the case. Rather than precipitating rapid accumulation, we show that meltwaters enhance growth in an already highly active phytoplankton population. Blooms observed in the wake of the receding ice edge can then be understood as the emergence of a growth process that started earlier under sea ice. Indeed, we estimate that growth initiation occurs, on average, 4–5 weeks before ice retreat, typically starting in August and September. Novel techniques using on-board data to detect the timing of ice melt were used. Furthermore, such growth is shown to occur under conditions of substantial ice cover (>90 \% satellite ice concentration) and deep mixed layers (>100 m), conditions previously thought to be inimical to growth. This led to the development of several box model experiments (with varying vertical depth) in which we sought to investigate the mechanisms responsible for such early growth. The results of these experiments suggest that a combination of higher light transfer (penetration) through sea ice cover and extreme low light adaptation by phytoplankton can account for the observed phenology.}},

	abstract = {{A new, closed nonlinear integral transformation relation is derived describing the mapping of a two-dimensional ocean wave spectrum into a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image spectrum. The general integral relation is expanded in a power series with respect to orders of nonlinearity and velocity bunching. The individual terms of the series can be readily computed using fast Fourier transforms. The convergence of the series is rapid. The series expansion is also useful in identifying the different contributions to the net imaging process, consisting of the real aperture radar (RAR) cross-section modulation, the nonlinear motion (velocity bunching) effects, and their various interaction products. The lowest term of the expansion with respect to nonlinearity order yields a simple quasi-linear approximate mapping relation consisting of the standard linear SAR modulation expression multiplied by an additional nonlinear Gaussian azimuthal cutoff factor. The cutoff scale is given by the rms azimuthal (velocity bunching) displacement. The same cutoff factor applies to all terms of the power series expansion. The nonlinear mapping relation is inverted using a standard first-guess wave spectrum as regularization term. This is needed to overcome the basic 180° mapping ambiguity and the loss of information beyond the azimuthal cutoff. The inversion is solved numerically using an iteration technique based on the successive application of the explicit solution for the quasi-linear mapping approximation, with interposed corrections invoking the full nonlinear mapping expression. A straightforward application of this technique, however, generally yields unrealistic discontinuities of the best fit wave spectrum in the transition region separating the low azimuthal wave number domain, in which useful SAR information is available and the wave spectrum is modified, from the high azimuthal wave number region beyond the azimuthal cutoff, where the first-guess wave spectrum is retained. This difficulty is overcome by applying a two-step inversion procedure. In the first step the energy level of the wave spectrum is adjusted, and the wave number plane rotated and rescaled, without altering the shape of the spectrum.

	abstract = {{An earlier algorithm for retrieving two-dimensional wave spectra from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image spectra is improved by using a modified cost function and introducing an additional iteration loop in which the first-guess input spectrum is systematically updated. For this purpose a spectral partitioning scheme is applied in which the spectrum is decomposed into a finite number of distinct wave systems. At each iteration step, the individual wave systems of the partitioned nth-guess wave spectrum are adjusted to agree in mean energy, frequency, and direction with the corresponding mean values of the associated wave systems of the SAR-inverted wave spectrum. The algorithm retrieves smooth wave spectra, avoiding the discontinuities which tended to arise in the previous algorithm in the transition region near the azimuthal wavenumber cutoff of the SAR image spectrum. The azimuthal cutoff of the SAR spectrum is also reproduced more accurately. The greatest improvement of the new retrieval algorithm is obtained when the discrepancies between the initial first-guess wave spectrum and the observed SAR spectrum are large. In this case the additional updating loop for the input spectrum enables the retrieved spectrum to adjust such that the simulated SAR spectrum matches more closely the observed SAR spectrum. The overall correlation of a large set of simulated SAR spectra with the measured SAR spectra is found to be significantly higher than with the previous algorithm, indicating that the algorithm not only overcomes isolated shortcomings of the earlier algorithm but also yields retrieved wave spectra which are generally more consistent with the input SAR data. An additional practical advantage of the new algorithm is that it returns spectral partioning parameters which can be used in SAR wave data assimilation schemes.}},

MIZ regions have high spatial and temporal variability in oceanic, atmospheric and ecological conditions. The salient qualitative feature of MIZs is their composition as a mosaic of individual floes that range in horizontal extent from centimetres to tens of kilometres. Thus the floe size distribution (FSD) can be used to quantitatively identify and describe them. Here, the history of FSD observations and theory, and the processes (particularly the impact of ocean waves) that determine floe sizes and size distribution, are reviewed.

	abstract = {{This study provides a new conceptional framework to understand the life cycle of the floe size distribution of Arctic sea ice and the associated processes. We derived the floe size distribution from selected multi-scale satellite imagery data acquired from different locations and times in the Arctic. Our study identifies three stages of the floe size evolution during summer – ‘fracturing’, ‘transition’ and ‘melt/wave fragmentation’. Fracturing defines the initial floe size distribution (N ∼ d−α, where d is floe size) formed from the spring breakup, characterized by the single power-law regime over d=30–3000 m with α ≈ 2. The initial floe size distribution is then modified by various floe fragmentation processes during the transition period, which is characterized by ‘selective’ fragmentation of large floes (d>200–300m) with variable α=2.5–3.5 depending on the degree of fragmentation. As ice melt intensifies, the melt fragmentation expands the single power-law regime into smaller floes (d=70m) with α=2.4–3.8, while a significant reduction of small floes (d<30–40m) occurs due to lateral melt. The shape factor shows an overall progression from elongated floes into rounded floes. The effects of scaling and wave-fracture are also discussed.}},

Recent observations have identified that large waves (>3m) have a linear attenuation rate, rather than the previously assumed exponential rate that is found for small waves. This suggests that waves penetrate further into the ice cover than previously expected. To explore this further we tested two exponentially decaying wave models. Contributions from nonlinear and wind generation source terms enabled both models to reproduce the observed regime shift. Essentially, the accumulation of nonlinear and wind energy contributions to long (and thus higher amplitude) waves can offset the ice damping, thus reducing the apparent attenuation.

It is shown that attenuation rates are insensitive to amplitudes for long-period waves but increase with increasing amplitude above some critical amplitude for short-period waves. Attenuation rates of the spectral components of the wavefield are calculated. It is shown that attenuation rates decrease with increasing wave period.

Directional spectral density is analyzed from in situ wave buoy data collected during a 3-day storm event in October 2015 in the Beaufort Sea. Two proxy metrics for wave amplitude obtained from energy density spectra, namely, spectral amplitude and significant wave height, are used to track the waves as they propagate along transects through the array of buoys in the predominantly pancake ice field. Two types of wave buoys are used in the analysis and compared, exhibiting significant differences in the wave energy density and directionality estimates. Although exponential decay is observed predominantly, one of the two buoy types indicates a potential positive correlation between wave energy density and the occurrence of linear wave decay, as opposed to exponential decay, in accord with recent observations in the Antarctic marginal ice zone. Factors affecting the validity of this observation are discussed. An empirical power law with exponent 2.2 is also found to hold between the exponential attenuation coefficient and wave frequency. The directional content of the wave spectrum appears to decrease consistently along the wave transects, confirming that wave energy is being dissipated by the pancake ice as opposed to being scattered by ice cakes.}},

	            Despite a recent resurgence of observational studies attempting to quantify the ice-induced attenuation of ocean waves in polar oceans, the physical processes governing this phenomenon are still poorly understood. Most analyses have attempted to relate the spatial rate of wave attenuation to wave frequency, but have not considered how this relationship depends on ice, wave, and atmospheric conditions. An in-depth analysis of the wave-buoy data collected during the 2017 Polynyas, Ice Production, and Seasonal Evolution in the Ross Sea (PIPERS) program in the Ross Sea is conducted. Standard techniques are used to estimate the spatial rate of wave attenuation α, and the influence of a number of potential physical drivers on its dependence on wave period T is investigated. A power law is shown to consistently describe the α(T) relationship, in line with other recent analyses. The two parameters describing this relationship are found to depend significantly on sea ice concentration, mean wave period, and wind direction, however. Looking at cross correlations between these physical drivers, three regimes of ice-induced wave attenuation are identified, which characterize different ice, wave, and wind conditions, and very possibly different processes causing this observed attenuation. This analysis suggests that parameterizations of ice-induced wave decay in spectral wave models should be piecewise, so as to include their dependence on local ice, wave, and wind conditions.}},

	abstract = {{Sea ice is not horizontally homogeneous on large scales. Its morphology is inherently discrete and made of individual floes. In recent years, sea ice models have incorporated this horizontal heterogeneity. The modelling framework considers an evolution equation for the probability density function of the floe size distribution (FSD) with forcing terms that represent the effects of several physical processes. Despite the modelling effort, a key question remains: What is the FSD emerging from the collection of all forcing processes? Field observations have long suggested that the FSD follows a power law, but this result has not been reproduced by models or laboratory experiments. The theoretical framework for FSD dynamics in response to physical forcings is presented. Wave-induced breakup is further examined with an emphasis on how it affects the FSD. Recent modelling results suggesting the consistent emergence of a log-normal distribution as a result of that process are further discussed. Log-normality is also found in a dataset of floe sizes, which was originally analysed under the power law hypothesis. A simple stochastic process of FSD dynamics, based on random fragmentation theory, is further shown to predict log-normality. We therefore conjecture that, in some situations, the emergent FSD follows a log-normal distribution.}},

The method is applied herein to ship motion data from the icebreaker R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov and recorded during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition across the Southern Ocean during the Austral summer 2016–17. The response amplitude operator of the vessel was estimated using two boundary element method models, namely NEMOH and HydroSTAR. An inter-comparison of model performance is discussed. The accuracy of the reconstructed sea states is assessed against concurrent measurements of the wave energy spectrum, which were acquired during the expedition with the marine radar WaMoS-II. Results show good agreement between reconstructed sea states (wave spectrum as well as integrated parameters) and direct observations. Model performances are consistent. Nevertheless, NEMOH produces slightly more accurate wave parameters when quantitatively compared against HydroSTAR.}},

We compare idealized simulations using two recent three-dimensional formulations for wave–ice interactions for flexible ice floes, with selected parametrizations for the scattering of ocean surface waves due to individual ice floes. These parametrizations are implemented in a modern version of the wave model WAVEWATCH III® (hereafter, WW3) as source terms in the action balance equation. The comparisons consist of simple hypothetical experiments to identify characteristics of the wave–ice parametrizations. Comparisons show that the two new wave–ice formulations give attenuation of wave heights that can be less intense in the direction of propagation than those of other considered formulations. Within the wave energy spectrum, the one-dimensional attenuation extends over the entire frequency domain to the high-frequency limit. Within the MIZ beyond the ice edge, there is evidence for a ‘roll-over’ effect in the simulations of attenuation. These new formulations can potentially improve previous parametrizations in simulations of wave scattering and attenuation within the MIZ.

Several characteristics of the recorded signals, including correlation between the different sensors, are analyzed. Horizontal and vertical motions are of the same order of magnitude. A clear transition in the signal properties is observed in relation with changes in incoming wave field and the development of cracks in the ice layer.

Recent changes in the climate and extent of the sea ice, together with increased economic activity and research interest in these regions, are driving factors for new measurements of sea ice dynamics. Waves in ice are important as they participate in the coupling between the open ocean and the ice-covered regions. Measurements are challenging to perform due to remoteness and harsh environmental conditions. While progress has been made in observing wave propagation in sea ice using remote methods, these are still relatively new measurements and would benefit from more in situ data for validation. In this article, we present an open source instrument that was developed for performing such measurements. The versatile design includes an ultra-low power unit, a microcontroller-based logger, a small microcomputer for on-board data processing, and an Iridium modem for satellite communications. Virtually any sensor can be used with this design. In the present case, we use an Inertial Motion Unit to record wave motion. High quality results were obtained, which opens new possibilities for in situ measurements in the polar regions. Our instrument can be easily customized to fit many in situ measurement tasks, and we hope that our work will provide a framework for future developments of a variety of such open source instruments.}},

The modeling platform is WAVEWATCH III® which accounts for non-stationarity, advection, wave generation, and other relevant processes. The resulting 9477 dissipation profiles are co-located with other variables such as ice thickness to quantify correlations which might be exploited in later studies to improve predictions. An average of dissipation profiles from cases of thinner ice near the ice edge is fitted to a simple binomial. The binomial shows remarkable qualitative similarity to prior observation-based estimates of dissipation, and the power dependence is consistent with at least three theoretical models, one of which assumes that dissipation is dominated by turbulence generated by shear at the ice-water interface. Estimated dissipation is lower closer to the ice edge, where ice is thinner, and waveheight is larger. The quantified correlation with ice thickness may be exploited to develop new parametric predictions of dissipation.}},

Through a close look at a representative set of theories, this paper investigates different physical processes that have produced different wave dispersion and attenuation. The existing theories have considered four major processes: scattering, flexural damping, viscoelastic damping and basal friction. Each theory looked into one of these processes and used a different mathematical formulation to model these processes. The low-frequency behaviours of the resulting spectral attenuation in these theories are fundamentally different from each other. Recent field observations have produced a large amount of data to calibrate and validate these theories. The uncertainties in using field measurements to determine attenuation due to ice covers are discussed. Both observational data and applications of these theories in field conditions suggest a multi-physics approach. A number of studies to further the theoretical development are recommended. It will take time for wave-in-ice models to reach the same level of performance as wave models for the open ocean, relying on the combined effort of theoretical, modelling and observational studies.}},

@article{squire_1995,
	abstract = {{The global geophysical role of wave-ice interaction has two facets: the physical effects of waves on an ice cover or of the ice on the waves; and the use of waves as a diagnostic tool in ice mechanics. The physical effects include the ability of waves to break up ice sheets into floes and to herd these floes into patterns that determine the morphology of the marginal ice zone, the break-up of tabular icebergs, the calving of ice tongues, and the generation of ambient noise. The diagnostic role stems from the long range propagation of wave energy in the form of flexural-gravity waves through ice sheets, and the information that the dispersion relation and attenuation rates can give us about ice properties and mechanics.Wave propagation across the fringe of ice floes separating the interior polar pack from the open ocean is a complex process. As ice approaches the ice edge from the far interior it encounters wave energy of gradually increasing intensity and gradually decreasing peak period, giving a steadily increasing degree of flexure to the vast ice sheets. Eventually the flexure causes the ice to break up into fragments, which themselves break again nearer the edge until a distribution of floe sizes is established with the smallest floes in the steepest wave field at the extreme ice edge. The floes thus created act as a shield for the interior pack, selectively damping out the shorter waves.If the wind is blowing away from the pack, the floes diffuse to produce an open ice field (or else organize themselves into bands). So long as the floes do not collide, the wave attenuation process can best be described by a scattering model. As soon as the pack becomes closer (e.g. with an on ice wind) floe collisions occur, generating high noise levels; a very compact pack behaves hydrodynamically either as a collection of very large floes or as a single entity. Since the floes can no longer surge in response to the waves, energy attenuation may be occurring more significantly in the form of viscous losses from the boundary layer under the ice. Further into the ice, where very large floes exist, wave energy propagates as flexural-gravity waves, with losses occurring either as reflections from leads or from pressure ridges, or as creep hysteresis losses due to flexure of the ice sheet. New wave energy can be created within such a continuous cover by a sufficiently strong wind or other processes, but the energies involved are very small and can only be detected by sensitive instruments. Finally, vast areas of shore-fast sea ice (Armstrong et al 1 973) skirt the boundaries and fill the harbors and inlets of the landmasses of the Arctic Ocean and the Antarctic continent. In regions sheltered from ocean waves and swell, these ice sheets may grow over several years to great thickness, while in most cases they will be broken up into ice floes by storm seas in the spring or will decay during the summer melt. Waves enter the ice sheet as flexural-gravity waves, causing the ice to flex rhythmically with their passing. If this flexing induces stresses that are greater than the ice can sustain, then fracture occurs, allowing part of the ice sheet to strip away. The remaining ice will then be subjected to analogous stresses and will fracture similarly. The systematic destruction of an ice sheet by this means is a rapid process which is a common occurrence, particularly where ice sheets abut open water. In this review the following values are used for certain physical quantities: Young's modulus for sea ice, E = 6 GPa; Poisson's ratio for sea ice, J1'= 0.3; density of sea water, p = 1025.0 kg m-3; and density of sea ice, p = 922.5 kg m-3•}},

Models have become much more sophisticated with the most recent ones allowing the sea-ice to be heterogeneous and the ocean to have variable depth. Pressure ridges, cracks, open and refrozen leads, and gradual or abrupt changes of material property can all be accommodated, and inhomogeneous marginal ice zones can also be effectively modelled. In this paper the author distinguishes between two major sea-ice types: continuous ice, such as is normally found in the central Arctic, and the ice of marginal neighbourhoods, i.e. near the open sea, where individual ice floes and cakes are present at typically lower levels of concentration.

Similarly, global wave forecasting models like WAVEWATCH III® need better parametrizations to capture the effects of a sea ice cover such as the marginal ice zone on incoming wave energy. Most parametrizations of wave propagation in sea ice assume without question that the frequency-dependent attenuation which is observed to occur with distance x travelled is exponential, i.e. A = A0 e−αx. This is the solution of the simple first-order linear ordinary differential equation dA/dx = −αA, which follows from an Airy wave mode ansatz Inline Formula. Yet, in point of fact, it now appears that exponential decay may not be observed consistently and a more general equation of the type dA/dx = −αAn is proposed to allow for a broader range of attenuation behaviours should this be necessary to fit data.

	abstract = {{A spectacular resurgence of interest in the topic of ocean wave/sea ice interactions has unfolded over the last two decades, fueled primarily by the deleterious ramifications of global climate change on the polar seas. The Arctic is particularly affected, with a widespread reduction of the extent, thickness, and compactness of its sea ice during the summer, creating an ice cover that is analogous to that in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. With the additional fetches over which waves can form and mature within more open ice fields, there has also been a documented global uptrend of winds and wave height, which is most severe at high latitudes. Bigger ocean waves affect the way sea ice forms, contribute to how the ice edge moves, penetrate farther into the sea ice, have more destructive power to break up the ice and to change the distribution of floe sizes because the ice is weaker, and assist in lateral melting. These feedbacks collectively identify a parametrization currently absent from Earth system models, as well as shortcomings in wave forecasts arising from limited understanding of the impact of sea ice on ocean waves.}},

Research oriented towards foundational elements of the marginal ice zone that relates to three unifying topic subclasses—namely (i) wave propagation through sea ice, (ii) floe size distributions and (iii) ice dynamics and break-up—and is encapsulated in mini-reviews provided by Thomson, Horvat and Dumont is revisited to distill it into a blueprint for the future guided by the cutting-edge, present-day knowledge documented herein by leading practitioners in the field. Six threads are signalled as imperative for prospective research, each with a bearing on Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice canopies in which the propensity for marginal ice zones to coexist with pack ice is greater as a result of global climate change reducing sea-ice resilience while increasing the prevalence and forcefulness of injurious storm winds and waves.

	abstract = {{A storm with significant wave heights exceeding 4 m occurred in the Beaufort Sea on 11–13 October 2015. The waves and ice were captured on 12 October by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on board Sentinel-1A, with Interferometric Wide swath images covering 400 × 1,100 km at 10 m resolution. This data set allows the estimation of wave spectra across the marginal ice zone (MIZ) every 5 km, over 400 km of sea ice. Since ice attenuates waves with wavelengths shorter than 50 m in a few kilometers, the longer waves are clearly imaged by SAR in sea ice. Obtaining wave spectra from the image requires a careful estimation of the blurring effect produced by unresolved wavelengths in the azimuthal direction. Using in situ wave buoy measurements as reference, we establish that this azimuth cutoff can be estimated in mixed ocean-ice conditions. Wave spectra could not be estimated where ice features such as leads contribute to a large fraction of the radar backscatter variance. The resulting wave height map exhibits a steep decay in the first 100 km of ice, with a transition into a weaker decay further away. This unique wave decay pattern transitions where large-scale ice features such as leads become visible. As in situ ice information is limited, it is not known whether the decay is caused by a difference in ice properties or a wave dissipation mechanism. The implications of the observed wave patterns are discussed in the context of other observations.}},

The dispersion relation was calculated from the measured phase difference between two adjacent sensors separated by a distance of approximately 60 m. Deviations from the gravity wave dispersion relation were observed during the growth phase of the waves and were consistent with the presence of flexural waves.

Here we present high-resolution thermal images of the ocean surface and complementary measurements of atmospheric variables that were acquired underway during one austral winter and one austral spring expedition in the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean. Skin temperature data and ice cover images were used to estimate the partitioning of the heterogeneous surface and calculate the heat fluxes to compare with ERA5 reanalyses. The winter MIZ was composed of different but relatively regularly distributed sea ice types with sharp thermal gradients. The surface-weighted skin temperature compared well with the reanalyses due to a compensation of errors between the sea ice fraction and the ice floe temperature. These uncertainties determine the dominant source of inaccuracy for heat fluxes as computed from observed variables. In spring, the sea ice type distribution was more irregular, with alternation of sea ice cover and large open water fractions even 400 km from the ice edge. The skin temperature distribution was more homogeneous and did not produce substantial uncertainties in heat fluxes. The discrepancies relative to reanalysis data are however larger than in winter and are attributed to biases in the atmospheric variables, with the downward solar radiation being the most critical.}},

The spectral shape of the energy added by noise, relative to the spectral shape of the true wave energy, is the critical aspect of the investigation. A negative bias in attenuation that grows in frequency is found across a range of realistic parameters. This negative bias decreases the observed attenuation rates at high frequencies, such that it can explain the rollover effect commonly reported in field studies of wave attenuation in sea ice. The published results from five field experiments are evaluated in terms of the noise bias, and a spurious rollover (or flattening) of attenuation is found in all cases. Remarkably, the wave heights are unaffected by the noise bias, because the noise bias occurs at frequencies that contain only a small fraction of the total energy.}},

	abstract = {{The propagation of ocean surface waves within the marginal ice zone (MIZ) is a defining phenomenon of this dynamic zone. Over decades of study, a variety of methods have been developed to observe and model wave propagation in the MIZ, with a common focus of determining the attenuation of waves with increasing distance into the MIZ. More recently, studies have begun to explore the consequences of wave attenuation and the coupled processes in the air–ice–ocean–land system. Understanding these coupled processes and effects is essential for accurate high-latitude forecasts. As waves attenuate, their momentum and energy are transferred to the sea ice and upper ocean. This may compact or expand the MIZ, depending on the conditions, while simultaneously modulating the wind work on the system. Wave attenuation is also a key process in coastal dynamics, where land–fast ice has historically protected both natural coasts and coastal infrastructure. With observed trends of increasing wave activity and retreating seasonal ice coverage, the propagation of waves within the MIZ is increasingly important to regional and global climate trends. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Theory, modelling and observations of marginal ice zone dynamics: multidisciplinary perspectives and outlooks’.}},

Two experiments are revisited in which irregular wave tests were conducted but not previously reported, one involving a single floe and the other a large number of floes, and the transmission coefficients for the irregular and regular wave tests are compared.

Here we bring a new perspective on synoptic sea ice changes by presenting the first in situ observations of an explosive extratropical cyclone crossing the winter Antarctic marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the South Atlantic. This is complemented by the analysis of subsequent cyclones and highlights the rapid variations that ice-landing cyclones cause on sea ice: Midlatitude warm oceanic air is advected onto the ice, and storm waves generated close to the ice edge contribute to the maintenance of an unconsolidated surface through which waves propagate far into the ice. MIZ features may thus extend further poleward in the Southern Ocean than currently estimated. A concentration-based MIZ definition is inadequate, since it fails to describe a sea ice configuration which is deeply rearranged by synoptic weather.}},

	abstract = {{Remote-sensing records over the last 40 years have revealed large year-to-year global and regional variability in Antarctic sea ice extent. Sea ice area and extent are useful climatic indicators of large-scale variability, but they do not allow the quantification of regions of distinct variability in sea ice concentration (SIC). This is particularly relevant in the marginal ice zone (MIZ), which is a transitional region between the open ocean and pack ice, where the exchanges between ocean, sea ice and atmosphere are more intense. The MIZ is circumpolar and broader in the Antarctic than in the Arctic. Its extent is inferred from satellite-derived SIC using the 15\%–80\% range, assumed to be indicative of open drift or partly closed sea ice conditions typical of the ice edge. This proxy has been proven effective in the Arctic, but it is deemed less reliable in the Southern Ocean, where sea ice type is unrelated to the concentration value, since wave penetration and free-drift conditions have been reported with 100\% cover. The aim of this paper is to propose an alternative indicator for detecting MIZ conditions in Antarctic sea ice, which can be used to quantify variability at the climatological scale on the ice-covered Southern Ocean over the seasons, as well as to derive maps of probability of encountering a certain degree of variability in the expected monthly SIC value. The proposed indicator is based on statistical properties of the SIC; it has been tested on the available climate data records to derive maps of the MIZ distribution over the year and compared with the threshold-based MIZ definition. The results present a revised view of the circumpolar MIZ variability and seasonal cycle, with a rapid increase in the extent and saturation in winter, as opposed to the steady increase from summer to spring reported in the literature. It also reconciles the discordant MIZ extent estimates using the SIC threshold from different algorithms. This indicator complements the use of the MIZ extent and fraction, allowing the derivation of the climatological probability of exceeding a certain threshold of SIC variability, which can be used for planning observational networks and navigation routes, as well as for detecting changes in the variability when using climatological baselines for different periods.}},

In the image, obtained in April 2000, the structure of the wave spectrum in the MIZ and its change from the open-water spectrum are consistent with a pancake layer 24 cm thick. Intensive in situ measurements of the pancake ice in the MIZ 280 km W of the image location were made from FS Polarstern during a period covering the satellite imaging, and also yielded a mean ice thickness of 24 cm. We conclude that this technique gives realistic results for ice thickness, whereas earlier work based on a different dispersion theory (mass loading) tended to over-estimate thickness.

This enabled us to fully test and apply the SAR-waves technique, first developed by Wadhams and Holt (1991), for deriving the thickness of frazil-pancake icefields from changed wave dispersion. A line of subimages from a main SAR image (usually CSK) is analyzed running into the ice along the main wave direction. Each subimage is spectrally analyzed to yield a wave number spectrum, and the change in the shape of the spectrum between open water and ice, or between two thicknesses of ice, is interpreted in terms of the viscous equations governing wave propagation in frazil-pancake ice. For each of the case studies considered here, there was good or acceptable agreement on thickness between the extensive in situ observations and the SAR-wave calculation. In addition, the SAR-wave analysis gave, parametrically, effective viscosities for the ice covering a consistent and narrow range of 0.03–0.05 m2 s−1.}},

	abstract = {{A wave-ice interaction model for the marginal ice zone (MIZ) is reported that calculates the attenuation of ocean surface waves by sea ice and the concomitant breaking of the ice into smaller floes by the waves. Physical issues are highlighted that must be considered when ice breakage and wave attenuation are embedded in a numerical wave model or an ice/ocean model. The theoretical foundations of the model are introduced in this paper, forming the first of a two-part series. The wave spectrum is transported through the ice-covered ocean according to the wave energy balance equation, which includes a term to parameterize the wave dissipation that arises from the presence of the ice cover. The rate of attenuation is calculated using a thin-elastic-plate scattering model and a probabilistic approach is used to derive a breaking criterion in terms of the significant strain. This determines if the local wave field is sufficient to break the ice cover. An estimate of the maximum allowable floe size when ice breakage occurs is used as a parameter in a floe size distribution model, and the MIZ is defined in the model as the area of broken ice cover. Key uncertainties in the model are discussed.}},

	abstract = {{The theoretical foundation of a wave–ice interaction model is reported in Part 1 of this study. The model incorporates attenuation of ocean surface waves by sea ice floes and the concomitant breaking of the floes by waves that determines the structure of the marginal ice zone (MIZ). A numerical implementation of the method is presented here. Convergence of the numerical method is demonstrated, as temporal and spatial grids are refined. A semi-analytical method, which does not require time-stepping, is also developed to validate the numerical results, when dispersion is neglected. The wave energy lost during ice breakage is parameterized, as part of the numerical method. Sensitivity studies are conducted in relation to the energy loss and also dispersive effects, the choice of the attenuation model, the properties of the wave field, and sea ice properties such as concentration, thickness and breaking strain. Example simulations intended to represent conditions in the Fram Strait in 2007, which exploit reanalyzed wave and ice model data, are shown to conclude the results section. These are compared to estimates of MIZ widths based on a concentration criteria, and obtained from remotely-sensed passive microwave images.}},

@article{willis_2023,
	abstract = {{Polar oceans and sea ice cover 15\\% of the Earth’s ocean surface, and the environment is changing rapidly at both poles. Improving knowledge on the interactions between the atmospheric and oceanic realms in the polar regions, a Surface Ocean–Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) project key focus, is essential to understanding the Earth system in the context of climate change. However, our ability to monitor the pace and magnitude of changes in the polar regions and evaluate their impacts for the rest of the globe is limited by both remoteness and sea-ice coverage. Sea ice not only supports biological activity and mediates gas and aerosol exchange but can also hinder some in-situ and remote sensing observations. While satellite remote sensing provides the baseline climate record for sea-ice properties and extent, these techniques cannot provide key variables within and below sea ice. Recent robotics, modeling, and in-situ measurement advances have opened new possibilities for understanding the ocean–sea ice–atmosphere system, but critical knowledge gaps remain. Seasonal and long-term observations are clearly lacking across all variables and phases. Observational and modeling efforts across the sea-ice, ocean, and atmospheric domains must be better linked to achieve a system-level understanding of polar ocean and sea-ice environments. As polar oceans are warming and sea ice is becoming thinner and more ephemeral than before, dramatic changes over a suite of physicochemical and biogeochemical processes are expected, if not already underway. These changes in sea-ice and ocean conditions will affect atmospheric processes by modifying the production of aerosols, aerosol precursors, reactive halogens and oxidants, and the exchange of greenhouse gases. Quantifying which processes will be enhanced or reduced by climate change calls for tailored monitoring programs for high-latitude ocean environments. Open questions in this coupled system will be best resolved by leveraging ongoing international and multidisciplinary programs, such as efforts led by SOLAS, to link research across the ocean–sea ice–atmosphere interface.}},

	abstract = {{Sea-ice drift in the Antarctic marginal ice zone (MIZ) is discussed using data from a 4-month-long drift of a buoy deployed on a pancake ice floe during the winter sea-ice expansion. We demonstrate increased meandering and drift speeds, and changes in the dynamical regimes of the absolute dispersion during cyclone activity, together with high correlations between drift velocities and wind from atmospheric reanalyses. This indicates a dominant physical control of wind forcing on ice drift and the persistence of free-drift conditions. These conditions occurred despite the buoy remaining largely in >80% ice concentrations and at distances >200 km from the estimated ice edge. The drift is additionally characterised by a strong inertial signature at 13.47 h, which appears initiated by passing cyclones. A wavelet analysis of the buoy's velocity confirms that the momentum transfer from winds at the multi-day frequencies is due to atmospheric forcing, while the initiation of inertial oscillations of sea ice has been identified as the secondary effect. Propagating storm-generated waves may initiate inertial oscillations by increasing the mobility of floes and enhance the drag of the inertial current. This analysis indicates that the Antarctic MIZ in the Indian Ocean sector remains much wider and mobile, during austral winter-to-spring, than defined by sea-ice concentration.}},

	abstract = {{Ship-based observations are used to describe regional and seasonal changes in the thickness distribution and characteristics of sea ice and snow cover thickness around Antarctica. The data set comprises 23,373 observations collected over more than 2 decades of activity and has been compiled as part of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) Antarctic Sea Ice Processes and Climate (ASPeCt) program. The results show the seasonal progression of the ice thickness distribution for six regions around the continent together with statistics on the mean thickness, surface ridging, snow cover, and local variability for each region and season. A simple ridge model is used to calculate the total ice thickness from the observations of level ice and surface topography, to provide a best estimate of the total ice mass, including the ridged component. The long-term mean and standard deviation of total sea ice thickness (including ridges) is reported as 0.87 ± 0.91 m, which is 40\% greater than the mean level ice thickness of 0.62 m. Analysis of the structure function along north/south and east/west transects revealed lag distances over which sea ice thickness decorrelates to be of the order of 100–300 km, which we use as a basis for presenting near-continuous maps of sea ice and snow cover thickness plotted on a 2.5° × 5.0° grid.}},
